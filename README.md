# Overview
This project was meant to help me learn about geometric modeling. The project itself is a simple pipe generator and editor that allows for the extrusion, beveling, rounding, and connecting of pipes to external meshes.

# Future
The existence of pipe modeling in an editor gives a great opportunity to implement gas/fluid flow through them. There is some existing code for a simulation layer, but I was unable to flesh out anything substantial due to time constraints. I may revisit this in the future.
